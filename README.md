With DeepSeek R1 out and all the hype around its coding ability so I tested it with a prompt: </br></br><i>"Make a simple snake game to keep score , show the snake speed , the speed should increase gradually </br>as the game progresses make the food an apple and make the snake to look like a worm with big eyes"</i>
</br></br> And here we are enjoy !!!</br></br>
Make sure you have pygame or install it by running:
</br>pip install pygame
